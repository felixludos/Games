# European Conquest



During junior high school, my friend and I developed a strategy board game inspired by [Quoridor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/624/quoridor), called European Conquest. After some playtesting, my mother and I implemented a [computer version](European%20Conquest%20alpha.exe) of the game in C#, which should still be runnable, regardless the rules are also [here](European%20Conquest%20Rules.pdf).

However, the current iteration of the game is somewhat unbalanced, and I hope to revisit it in the future.
