Commissions
===========

- uses another deck → commissions
- as part of setup, the top three cards of the commissions deck are placed faceup on the table for all to see to make up the bank commissions pool. on the other side of the (face down) commissions deck leave a space open to form the bank sentiment. additionally, leave some space near the commissions deck to place the fulfilled commissions for everyone to see.
- at the beginning of the game, each player draws 4 commission cards.
    - each player keeps one commission and passes the rest of them on to the player next to them (in herald order).
    - next, each player keeps 2 of the commission cards and passes the remainder to the next player
    - continue to pass on one more card until everyone has passed one card on, after which everyone should have 4 cards
    - throughout the game, the players should keep their commissions face down next to them and separate from all their other cards, they do not count towards tax, and they cannot be used for stalls, actions, or discards
- during any market phase, players can take a new action called “commission”
    - which involves selecting one of their commission cards and a card in their stall of matching rank (hereafter referred to as the “goods” card)
    - add the commissions card to the fulfilled commissions, so all players can see them
    - the player earns one coin for every commission card of the same rank that is present in the fulfilled commissions plus one bonus coin if the bank sentiment (top card in the stack) is lower or equal in rank to the current commission.
    - place the goods card on top of the bank sentiment stack
    - lastly, the player selects any one of the bank commissions or draws the top card of the commissions deck and adds it to their other commissions.
- at the end of the game, the commissions can be used in two different ways for bonuses.
    - firstly, if the player has a card of rank matching the address card of any of their buildings, that building counts as one additional victory point (only if the building is valid, and each building can receive at most one such bonus VP)
    - secondly, any of your remaining commissions can be appended to one of your journeys (provided the journeys expansion is in play)
