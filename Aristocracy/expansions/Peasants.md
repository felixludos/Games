# Peasants Expansion for Aristocracy: Game Rules

- Required material: an additional deck of cards, thereafter called the "Peasants deck".

**Objective:**
The Peasants expansion introduces a new dynamic to Aristocracy through the use of peasant cards. These cards represent additional actions players can take during the game. The goal is to efficiently manage these peasants to gain advantages while ensuring their needs are met to avoid penalties.

**Setup:**

Shuffle the Peasants deck and place it face-down somewhere accessible to all players.

**Gameplay:**

1. **Acquiring Peasants:**
   - **Recruit Action:** Spend one action to draw a peasant card and add it face-up near your play area.
   - **Hire Action:** Spend one coin and one action to draw three peasant cards. Choose one to keep and discard the others.

2. **Using Peasants:**
   - Acquired peasants can be used in the same year (a king, queen, jack cycle) they are obtained.
   - Each peasant allows one additional action during the year.
   - Unused peasants remain in your area for future rounds.

3. **Providing for Peasants:**
   - At the end of each jack phase (year-end), players must provide for their peasants.
   - Methods of Provision:
     - Matched Rank: Peasants matching the rank of the address card of any of their buildings are automatically provided for (i.e. for free).
     - Building Capacity: Each building type can support a certain number of peasants (Farms and Chateaus: 1 peasant, Estates: 2 peasants).
     - Monetary Provision: Pay one coin per peasant for provision.
   - Failure to Provide: If unable to provide for all peasants, they revolt. Revolting peasants leave, and you must downgrade a building or, if you do not have any building built, you must discard a card from your hand (if you have any).

4. **Peasant Management:**
   - Used peasants are flipped over at the end of their action and can be reset (flipped back face-up) at the year-end.
   - Unused peasants may be abandoned at the end of the year (before provision) to avoid penalties.

**Variants and Special Rules:**

1. **Queen's Royal Action Variant:**
   - This variant involves managing peasants through the queen's actions, offering options like gaining, replacing, or managing peasants based on rank or suit.
   - Collecting sets of peasants may grant benefits like no provision requirement or additional abilities.

2. **Visitation Rule Adjustment:**
   - When visiting and encountering a fake building, a player can affect the opponent's peasants: either take one of their peasants or draw and add a new peasant to their collection.

**Notes:**
- Peasants are permanent once gained unless they revolt.
- Peasants do not count as part of the player's stall and can be used without cards in the stall. However, the player must have at added at least one card to their stall to use peasants.
- The game encourages strategic management of peasants to maximize benefits while minimizing the risk of revolt.
