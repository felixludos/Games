Spies & Rumors
==============

- this expansion adds another full deck of cards which are called “spies” (which can occasionally also be used as rumors)
- importantly this expansion not only adds some new rules and mechanics, but it actually modifies a relatively important part of the game: the queen’s special action
- during setup all players receive (number of players - 1) spy cards face down. if there are more than 2 players, each player must give exactly one of those spy cards to each opponent of their choice - such that after all spies have been distributed all players have the same number of spies again (receiving exactly 1 from each opponent). Players may not look at the spies they have received until after they have distributed all the spies they have been dealt originally.
- the discard pile of spies is facedown and cannot be looked at by any players throughout the game
- during the game there are now 4 new regular actions
    - hire spy: pay 1 coin and draw two new spies, keep one and discard the other
    - network spies: discard two of your spies and draw two new ones, discard one of the newly drawn spies, and keep the other.
    - rumor: add one of your spies to an opponents building (this spy now becomes a rumor)
    - gossip: pick an opponent’s building (not your own), you may look at all the rumors of that building and may optionally exchange at most one of those rumors with one of your spies. afterward, put back all the rumors (facedown)
    - visitation: (unlike in the base game) is no longer a royal action, so it can be taken at any phase without having to pay a coin and without discarding a royal card.
        - choose one of your oppenent’s buildings.
        - if the building already has a face up card other than the (required) address card (ie. it is “open”), then you may (optionally) look at the remaining face down cards of the building, and then draw a new spy card.
        - if the building does not have a face up card (ie. it is not open), then you may inspect all the face down cards:
            - if any do not match the address card, you may pick one and turn it face up (leaving all the others face down). if you do, draw two new spy cards. keep one and give the other to the owner of the building.
            - if all cards match the address card, then return then unchanged
- the queen’s royal action is now “blackmail”, which (just like all royal actions) can only be taken if a queen is discarded or, during the queen phase, you pay one coin.
    - choose an opponent’s building with at least one rumor attached as a target of the blackmail.
    - now the owner of that building has the option to defend by discarding one of their spies with the same value as the address card of the building. if they do so, they may remove one of the rumors attached to that building, and the action is over.
    - however, if the owner is unable to defend, they must choose to accept or reject the blackmail.
        - if they accept, they must choose one of their stall cards and add it to your stall (you do not gain an action, even if the other player has not taken their turn yet).
        - if they reject, then all rumor cards attached to that building are turned face up, and if at least one of the rumors has the same value as the address card of the building, then the owner must add all the cards in their stall to your stall (again, you do not gain any actions). finally, they may draw one spy card.
- each building can contain at most as many rumors as cards that make up the building - 1.
- at the end of the game for scoring, the total number of spy cards is the third tie breaker (after VP and journeys) (or the second tie breaker if the journeys expansion is not included)

## Variant: Humble Churches

When playing with the churches expansion, it is recommended to change some of the rules regarding churches to rebalance things now that visitation has changed so significantly:

- when a church event occurs, before the score order is determined, each player in herald order may reveal upto one card of each building that doesn’t match the address card (consequently the building is not included in the calculation of the score order for the church).

# Old

Motivation: encourage visitation and build fake buildings. Encourage coordination between players (with backstabbing)

- possibly requires another deck of spies/rumors
    - alternatively could be taken from the standard cards
    - rumor/spy cards are called “spies” as long as you keep them (hidden), and called “rumors” if you add them to an opponent's building
- rumors at buildings
    - each building can hold up to as many rumors as the storage cards
    - rumors are placed facedown separately from the storage cards, but close enough to know that the rumors are attached to that specific building
    - importantly: the owner of the building may not look at the rumors on their building - instead only the opponents may (under certain circumstances) look at, exchange, add, or remove rumors.
    - blackmail - an extension or alternative to visitation
        - if a building has at least 1 rumor, an opponent that comes visiting may choose to blackmail the owner of the building (instead of the inspecting the storage as usual during visitation)
        - when blackmailed, the owner may either pay the blackmailer 1 coin, or uncover all rumor cards
            - nothing happens if the victim (building owner) has no cards
        - if at least one of the values of the rumor cards matches the address of the building, the blackmail is successful
            - defending: if the victim has a spy with the same value as the address card, then they only have to discard that spy and are spared the other consequences
            - the victim loses all their spies (unplayed rumor cards)
            - (possibly) the building is downgraded
            - alternatively, the
            - all rumor cards are discarded
        - if none of the rumor cards match the address, the blackmail fails
            - all rumor cards are discarded
- tea time/party - occasionally (maybe after each jack phase, or between each phase), all players can exchange spies and/or rumors or recruit new spies
    - mechanics might be similar to the ball

# Additional Balancing

- when downgrading (either by force or by choice) a farm, you must choose only between the farms of yours that have the fewest rumors attached. if there are multiple buildings with the same number of rumors, you may choose any of them.
  - this rule does not apply when downgrading an estate or chateau
  - when downgrading by choice, you must downgrade a non-farm before any farm with at least one rumor
