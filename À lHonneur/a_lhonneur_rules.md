# Game Rules

## Requirements

- 2x52 packs of regular (french) playing cards (without jokers)
- (optional but strongly recommended) a multiplayer timer to keep track of how much time each player has left, including an increment each time they take a turn (for Android phones, I recommend [TurnsTimer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deakishin.yourturntimer))

## Setup

Shuffle the two packs together and deal 10 cards face down for each player, and give an 11th to the starting player (selected randomly). Place the remaining cards face down to form the draw deck in the middle of the table such that all players can reach it, and so a face up discard pile can be started next to the deck.

The players should not look at their cards until the game start (i.e. the timer starts). If a player does look at their cards early, they must draw an additional card.

Set the timer such that each player has a total of 2 minutes with a 5 second increment for each turn they take.

When all players are ready, start the timer for the starting player only and then all players may look at their cards. Since the starting player was dealt an extra card, they skip step 1 in their first turn.

## Turn Overview

It is only a player’s turn when their timer is running (just like in chess).

1. Draw a card from the deck and add it to your hand. (This is technically the only mandatory step in your turn, so if you want to, you can just draw a card and then end your turn to save time.)
2. You may play any number of cards face up on the table to form new patterns and/or add any number of cards to existing face-up patterns. For any card you use from the discard pile, you must also take all cards above it.
You may also break and rearrange any patterns on the table (no matter which player originally played the pattern) (much like in Rummikub).
Note, that any face up cards you use during your turn cannot be picked up into your hand or discarded. Any face up card you do not form into a valid pattern becomes your “orphan” card. All of your orphans are placed face up in front of you. Other players may use your orphans to form their own pattern during their turn, but as long as they don’t take them, they stay with you.
3. Optionally, you may discard one of the cards in your hand by placing it on top of the discard pile. Generally, the cards in the discard pile should be splayed such that all players can see not just the top card but several (or ideally all) discarded cards beneath in case they want to claim them.
4. Lastly, to end your turn stop your timer so that the timer of the next player starts. At this point, you should get the 5 seconds added to your timer. And the timer of the next player (in clockwise order) begins and that player begins their turn. Other players should monitor the patterns you rearrange and play from your hand, and if they notice any invalid patterns after you end your turn, then all cards in the invalid pattern become your orphans.

### Card Patterns

A pattern is technically always a set of three cards which form either a sequence or a group.

- **Sequences**: All cards in a sequence must have the **same suit** with sequentially changing ranks, where looping back around from K → A → 2 **is** allowed.
- **Groups**: All cards in a group must have the **same rank with all different suits**.

However, you may also form "multi-patterns" which are made up of multiple individual patterns that partially overlap. For a multi-pattern to be valid, each card in the multi-pattern must form a valid pattern with each of its adjacent cards. Note that the all adjacent cards need not be part of the same pattern (see example 3)

Some examples of valid multi-patterns are:
1. 2♠, 3♠, 4♠, 5♠ - a sequence of 4, equivalent to two overlapping sequences.
2. 6♠, 6♥, 6♦, 6♣ - a group of 4, equivalent to two overlapping groups.
3. K♠, A♠, 2♠, 3♠ - a sequence of 4, equivalent to two overlapping sequences (note that K → A → 2 is allowed).
4. 4♠, 5♠, 6♠, 6♥, 6♦ - an overlapping sequence and a group.
5. 6♠, 5♠, 4♠, 5♠, 6♠ - two overlapping sequences of 3
6. 7♠, 7♥, 7♦, 7♠ - eventhough there are two 7♠, they are part of different groups (7♠, 7♦, 7♠) and (7♠, 7♥, 7♠).
7. 8♠, 8♦, 8♣, 8♠, 8♦ - a group of 5, equivalent to two overlapping groups.
8. K♠, Q♠, J♠, J♥, J♦, Q♦, K♦ - two sequences with a group in the middle (compare this to the invalid example 3)

Some examples of invalid multi-patterns are:
1. 7♠, 7♦, 7♠ - the two 7♠ are part of the same group, so this is invalid.
2. 7♠, 7♥, 7♠, 7♦ - the two 7♠ are part of the same group (the first in the multi-pattern), so this is invalid. Note that the only difference to valid example 4 above is the order of the cards, so order matters!
3. K♠, Q♠, J♠, J♦, Q♦, K♦ - the two sequences are not overlapping (specifically the J♠, J♦ don't form a valid pattern with any adjacent cards), but if you separate them into two independent sequences (remember once cards are face up, they can freely be rearranged), the two sequences are valid.


## Game End

There are two ways for the game to end: firstly, if a player runs out of time, the game ends for that player only and they keep all their cards (in their hand and orphans) until the game ends for all other players (although other players may continue to use their orphans if they want). If there is only one player left, the game is over and that player may discard all their hand cards as well as orphans.

Secondly, the game ends if a player is able to get rid of all of the cards in their hand and has no orphans left at the end of their turn. In that case, the game ends for all players, and you move on to scoring.

### Scoring

Once the game has ended for all players, any player that still have cards in their hand left or orphans, must add the value of all those remaining cards where aces count as 1 points, all face cards count as 10 points, and all remaining cards count as the same number of points as their rank.

The player with the least number of points wins. However, it is suggested to keep track of everyone’s points over the course of several rounds of the game (e.g. one round for each player so that each player is the starting player once) and then declare the winner after summing each player’s points after all rounds.
