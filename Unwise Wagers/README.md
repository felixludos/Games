# Unwise Wagers

This game involves coming up with some question with an unambiguous answer (usually by googling), then all players provide a guess for the answer, and finally players bet on which of the guesses is the correct one. The trick is that the player coming up with the question is rewarded based on how much the players that get it wrong bet on the wrong answer, so the best questions are ones that players think they know the answer to, but are actually incorrect.

The inspiration with this game was to combine the betting mechanics of [Wits and Wagers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20100/wits-wagers) with creative guessing games like [Dixit](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit) or [Wise and Otherwise](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2652/wise-and-otherwise) to avoid the issue of needing a preexisting set of questions.

Currently, the game is only implemented as a Discord bot [here](https://github.com/felixludos/ludos/blob/figged/ludos/games/wise_otherwise/unwise.py), but soon I'll write out the rules in a separate document here.
