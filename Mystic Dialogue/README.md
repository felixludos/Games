# Mystic Dialogue

This deep cooperative deduction game uses a deck of special cards where each card is unique and contains lots of strange details such as in [Dixit](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit) or [Mysterium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181304/mysterium). Similar to [Mysterium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181304/mysterium), the players must uncover the details in a murder mystery where each player has a different part of the story, however they must communicate exclusively through cards.

At the heart of the game is the idea of collaboratively building a highly abstract language and then using it to communicate very specific information (e.g. the location or suspect in the murder mystery).

Currently, the game is only implemented as a Discord bot (see [here](https://github.com/felixludos/ludos/blob/figged/ludos/games/mysterium/dialogue.py)), but soon I'll write out the rules in a separate document here.
