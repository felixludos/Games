A casual social negotiation game created in September 2023.

- **Players**: 5-15 (recommended 6-10)
- **Materials**: two packs of french playing cards, 1 timer
- **Duration**: Takes about 15 minutes

## **Setup**
1. **Seating**: Players sit in a circle with a neighbor on their left and right.
2. **Cards**: Shuffle all cards and deal the following number per player:
   - 5 players: 20 cards each
   - 6 players: 17 cards each
   - 7 players: 14 cards each
   - 8 players: 13 cards each
   - 9 players: 11 cards each
   - 10 players: 10 cards each
   - 11 players: 9 cards each
   - 12 players: 8 cards each
   - 13 players: 8 cards each
   - 14 players: 7 cards each
   - 15 players: 6 cards each
3. **Timer**: Set a countdown timer for 10 minutes and make it visible to all players.
4. **Initial Hands**: Players do not look at their cards until the timer starts.

## **Gameplay**

**Start the Timer**: When the timer begins, players may look at their cards.

**Trading**: Players may freely trade their cards but only with their immediate neighbors to their left and right. Specifically, there are two types of trades:
- **Swap**: Exchange the same number of cards between players.
- **Loan**: Exchange different number of cards, but the debtor must return the same number by the end of the game. The loaner may "call in" their loan at any time, in which case the debtor must return the same number of cards before making further swaps. However, debtors may choose what cards to return.

## **Scoring**
1. **End of Timer**: When the timer reaches 0, trading stops, and each player must have the same number of cards they started with (so all loans must be repaid immediately).

2. **Patterns**:
   - A **group**: At least two cards of the same rank.
   - A **sequence**: At least two consecutive cards of the same suit. (Ranks loop: 2 follows A and A follows K.)
   - Each card may belong to only one pattern.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - **Primary Score**: (Length of your longest pattern) × (Sum of your neighbors' longest patterns).
   - **Bonus Points**: For every additional pattern in your hand, add (length - 1) to your score.

4. **Example**:
   - Your patterns: Sequence of 4, sequence of 3, two pairs.
   - Neighbors' longest patterns: Group of 5, sequence of 6.
   - Your score: \( 4 × (5 + 6) + (3-1) + (2-1) + (2-1) = 48 \).

5. **Tiebreakers**:
   - 1st: Highest rank in your longest pattern (K is highest).
   - 2nd: Higher of the two longest-pattern ranks among your neighbors.
   - 3rd: Lower of the two longest-pattern ranks among your neighbors.
