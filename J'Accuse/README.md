A devilishly tricky social deduction card game for 5-12 players created by Felix Leeb and colleagues in early 2023.

The game requires two decks of regular (French) playing cards, and a pile of fungible tokens to keep track of experience points.

Check out the full rules here: [J'Accuse](J'Accuse.md).

The gameplay shares some similarities with [Secret Hitler](https://www.secrethitler.com/), 
but gives players more flexibility in their roles, and thus more opportunities for organic cooperation (and potential betrayal).
