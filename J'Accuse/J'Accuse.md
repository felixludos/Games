## Game Overview

The game can be played with 5-14 players, best with 5-9.

The game is played with two decks of French playing cards (52 cards + 3 Jokers each). (Although, technically, you only need one deck if there are not more than 7 players).

It is recommended to have a pile of counters to keep track of each players’ experience points placed in the middle of the table.

## Game Setup

1. First prepare the influence card deck using the guide below. The suit doesn’t matter (only the color red/black), and there should always be an equal number of red and black influence cards for each rank. So if it says "2-10" that means use all the cards of one deck with values 2 through 10, while "8 2-8" means use all the cards of both decks with values 2 through 8. If you need to use the Jokers, then make sure to assign one Joker to red and one to black. In the rare case that you need to use a third Joker, assign that to neither red nor black (and make sure all players can differentiate the Jokers). Note, that the order of card ranks from lowest to highest are always: Joker→A→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9→10→J→Q→K.

2. Then, prepare the network card deck out of the remaining cards. Ideally of a completely different deck than the influence cards so that no one confuses the influence with the network cards. You will need N/2 red network cards and N/2 black network cards (rounded up), where N is the number of players. For the network cards, only the color matters (so you could even use slips of paper labeled "red" and "black" on one side).

3. Mix the network cards and deal one to each player face down (returning the extra card to the box without looking at it, if there is an odd number of players).
 
4. After all the influence and network card decks are prepared, return all remaining cards to the box. However, it is recommended to keep a small stack of red and black cards nearby (which can easily be differentiated from the influence and network cards). These may be unused cards from the network deck or just slips of paper. These cards will be used for "free policies".

5. Each player looks at the network card they received, and then places it face down to their immediate left, in between themselves and the player sitting to their left.

6. Then each player then also looks at the network card to their immediate right.

7. The two network cards each player looked at make up their “network” which will remain fixed for the whole game. Each player is only ever allowed to look at their corresponding network cards, but note that each network card is shared by two players sitting next to each other.

## Generation Setup

The game is played over a number of “generations”, the total number of which should be agreed upon beforehand. It’s required to play an even number of generations and the more generations are played, the more strategic the game becomes. It is recommended to play 4, but 2 generations also works for a quick game.

1. At the beginning of each generation shuffle all the influence cards and deal 5-7 influence cards to each player face down (depending on the total number of players, see the guide above). If there is a influence cards remaining (i.e. when playing with 5 or 13 players), place it on the table face down to form a discard pile.

2. Each player may freely look at the influence cards dealt to them (which makes up their hand), and may, if they choose, also show their hand cards to other players. 
   - All players start with an equal number of influence cards in their hand, but over time some players may run out of influence cards before others. Once a player runs out of influence cards, they may no longer vote in elections or get accused, so they are effectively out for the rest of the generation. However, their membership card should be left face down and until the generation is over for scoring.

3. Now each player selects one of their influence cards to place face down in front of them. This card is called the “membership” card of the player, and should be placed in between the player’s two network cards.

4. Place a stack of red and a stack of black cards nearby to use as free policies when needed.

5. The stability of each generation begins at 5.

6. If this is not the first generation, then the side that won the previous generation receives one free policy at the beginning.

7. Finally, the generation begins with an election.

## Gameplay

### Election

1. All players that still have at least one influence card remaining select one of their influence cards and holds on to it face down in front of them.

2. Once everyone is ready, and there is a countdown, all players simultaneously choose to reveal their card (vote) or return the card to their hand without revealing it (i.e. abstain).
    - All players that abstain do not participate in the election anymore.
    - If all players abstain, a free policy is passed of the same color as the most recently passed policy (nothing is passed if no policy has been passed yet).

3. For all cards that were played face up, check if all cards have the same color (red vs black). If so, then a "consensus" has occurred, so a free policy of the corresponding color is passed, all players that voted take back their influence card, and a new election round from the beginning (without anyone becoming president). 
   - If at any time, there are as many policies passed in a row as the current stability (starts at 5), then the generation ends immediately with the corresponding color winning and proceed to generation scoring.

4. Otherwise, the player that played the highest rank card wins the vote and becomes president. If there is a tie, then all votes are left on the table while another round of voting begins with the remaining cards.
    - However, note that any players that abstain, cannot join in the later rounds, and players that do not have any remaining influence cards to participate also cannot continue to vote.
    - For subsequent rounds of voting, make sure to check for a “consensus” - i.e. all votes have the same color, in which case the corresponding color receives a free policy, and a new election round starts from the beginning (and all players get all their votes back).
5. Once the winner of the election has been determined, the last played vote of the winning player is discarded (face down on the table), while all other votes are returned to the respective players. 
   - The president receives one experience token for winning the election. Experience tokens are kept for the remainder of the game, but may also freely be exchanged between players (e.g. in deals or as bribes/blackmail).

### Presidency

When a player becomes president they may first optionally choose to "parley" with another player. This is done as follows: they selects some number of their remaining influence cards and then they choose one opponent (the “target”) who has at least that many influence cards remaining in their hand. The target player now selects the same number of their own influence cards and swaps them with those selected by the president.

After that, the president may take one of these actions, as follows:

- **Defect** - they discard their membership card, and replace it with one of their influence cards.
- **Accuse** - Select a target player (who still possesses at least one influence card in their hand) and accuse them of either having a red or black membership card. Then reveal the target player’s membership card and resolve as follows:
    - If the accusation was correct, then the revealed membership card is added to the president’s hand. The target player must replace their membership card with one of their remaining influence cards (secretly). Finally, the president must play one of their influence cards face up on the table (thereby enacting a policy). After that, their presidency is over and a new election begins.
        - If as many policies of the same color are passed in a row as the stability (5, initially), then the generation ends and the corresponding color wins that generation (then move on to scoring the generation).
    - If the accusation was incorrect, then the target takes their revealed membership card back into their hand, and selects one of their influence cards (secretly) to become their new membership card. Then the target player becomes president, however that player may not accuse any player who was a president since the last election.
        - If three accusations are incorrect since the last election, then the state is “in crisis” and the stability is decreased by 1 for the remainder of the generation. Then instead of the accused player becoming president, proceed directly to a new election round.

## Scoring

### End of Generation

After each generation ends, all players reveal their membership cards and the winning color is recorded. Each player that has a membership card of the same color as the winning one, receives 1 VP. 

Do not reveal or change the network cards yet.

### End of Game

After all generations are played, each player’s network cards are revealed and each player gets 1 VP for each network card that matches the winning color for each of the generations that have been played.

- So overall, a player can get at most 3 VP in one generation, if their membership and both network cards matched the winning color.

Any ties are resolved by who has more experience tokens at the end of the game (remember experience tokens may freely be exchanged between players for favors or as bribes).
