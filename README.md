# Aristocracy

A strategy card game created by Felix Leeb over the course of the Summer of 2018 (and beyond).
Dedicated to Lauren Martini.

This repo contains the [rules](Aristocracy.md) for the base game, as well as variants and expansions. 
Overall, I would recommend playing the base game with the Journeys and Commissions expansions.

## Expansions

Aside from the [base game](Aristocracy.md), there are currently several expansions finished or in progress. Here is a list of them:

| Expansion                                | Description                                                                                                                           | Start Date | Status           |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------|
| [Journeys](expansions/Journeys.md)       | Allows players to go on journeys by forming and extending sequences to collect luxury goods (which are tax free!).                    | Jan 2022   | Completed        |
| [Commissions](expansions/Commissions.md) | Players begin with secret commissions which can be used for a big payouts or extra victory points at the end of the game.             | Jan 2022   | Completed        |
| [Churches](expansions/Churches.md)       | Show how pious you are by titheing more than your opponents - after all, you wouldn't want anyone to accuse you of heresy?            | Jan 2022   | Completed        |
| [Spies & Rumors](expansions/Spies.md)    | Gossip is in the air and spies lurk behind every corner. With a few little rumors, a minor scandal might just spiral into utter ruin. | Apr 2022   | Unbalanced       |
| Peasants                                 | As all proper nobility know, the peasants yearn for an honest day's work - just don't forget to feed them!                            | Feb 2023   | Not Released Yet |

Currently, the rules for the expansions are still only notes, rather than properly formatted rules.
