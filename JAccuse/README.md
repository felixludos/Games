# J'Accuse

A devilishly tricky social deduction card game for 5-12 players created by Felix Leeb and colleagues in early 2023.

The game requires two decks of regular (French) playing cards, and a pile of fungible tokens to keep track of experience points.

Check out the full rules here: [J'Accuse](J'Accuse.md).

The gameplay shares some similarities with [Secret Hitler](https://www.secrethitler.com/), 
but gives players more flexibility in their roles, and thus more opportunities for organic cooperation (and potential betrayal).

This game could not have been created without the help of my friends, family, and colleagues who generously provided their 
time and invaluable feedback.
