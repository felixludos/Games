# J'Accuse

> *At the table sit both friends and foes. If you can tell them apart, victory is just a few steps away, but beware – the farther you get, the more likely you end up with a knife in your back.*


Created by Felix Leeb and colleagues in early 2023. Dedicated to Lauren Martini.


## Welcome to J'Accuse!

J'Accuse is a social deduction game for 5-14 players (best with 6-8) where you'll navigate a shadowy world of influence and intrigue. Players have hidden connections (their "network") to either Red or Black factions. Your goal is to subtly manipulate events, accuse your rivals, and ensure that by the end of the game, you are aligned with the winning faction. This rulebook first explains how to play a complete single-generation game. A "Multi-Generation Campaign" variant for longer play is described at the end.

**Playing Time (Single Generation):** Approx. 30-60 minutes.

## What You'll Need

The game can be played with 5-14 players, best with 6-8.

* **Playing Cards:** Two standard 52-card French playing card decks, possibly including up to 3 Jokers (depending on the number of players, see below).
    * You might only need one deck if playing with 7 or fewer players, but using two distinct decks (e.g., different back designs) for "Influence cards" and "Network cards" is highly recommended to avoid confusion.
* **Experience Tokens:** A pile of counters (chips, beads, etc.) to track players' Experience Points (XP).

## Preparing for a Single Generation

Setting up your first game of J'Accuse involves preparing two special decks of cards: the **Influence Deck** and the **Network Deck**.

**Card Ranks:** Throughout the game, card ranks are as follows, from lowest to highest:
**Joker → A → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → J → Q → K**

### 1. Prepare the Influence Card Deck

The Influence Deck is what players will use to vote, enact policies, and perform actions. Consult the table below to determine which cards to use based on the number of players.

| # of Players | Included Ranks                               | Initial Hand Size | Total Cards in Influence Deck |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------- |
| 5            | 2-10                                         | 7                 | 36 (deal 35, 1 discard)     |
| 6            | 2-10                                         | 6                 | 36                          |
| 7            | 2 Jokers (1 Red, 1 Black) + A-10             | 6                 | 42                          |
| 8            | 2-K                                          | 6                 | 48                          |
| 9            | 2 Jokers (1 Red, 1 Black) + A-K              | 6                 | 54                          |
| 10           | 2 Jokers (1 Red, 1 Black) + 2-K              | 5                 | 50                          |
| 11           | 3 Jokers (1R, 1B, 1 Neutral) + A-K           | 5                 | 55                          |
| 12           | Use cards from *two decks*: 8x (2-8) + 4 Jokers (2R, 2B) | 5                 | 60                          |
| 13           | Use cards from *two decks*: 8x (2-9) + 2 Jokers (1R, 1B) | 5                 | 68 (deal 65, 3 discard)     |
| 14           | Use cards from *two decks*: 8x (2-9) + 4x (10s) + 2 Jokers (1R, 1B) | 5                 | 70                          |

*Table Notes:*
* *"2-10"* means all cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) from the required number of suits to ensure Red/Black balance. For one deck, this means 2 red suits and 2 black suits for these ranks.
* *"8x (2-8)"* means using all cards ranked 2 through 8 from *both* decks (four red suits and four black suits of these ranks).
* Remember: Always maintain an equal number of Red and Black cards for each rank used in the Influence Deck. If using only Neutral Jokers, see notes in "Prepare the Influence Card Deck."


* **Color Balance:** For any given rank (e.g., all the 7s), there must always be an equal number of red cards (Hearts/Diamonds) and black cards (Spades/Clubs).
* **Jokers:**
    * If Jokers are used as per the guide, assign one Joker to be "Red" and another to be "Black." Clearly differentiate them. If a third Joker is needed (11 players), it is considered "Neutral" (neither Red nor Black). Ensure all players can tell the Jokers apart.
    * If your decks only contain Jokers that are all identical (e.g., all graphically neutral, not pre-assigned a color by suit): These can still be used. When played as a vote, a Neutral Joker counts as an "empty vote." It does not contribute to a color for Consensus and cannot win an election (it has no rank for winning purposes). However, playing it does count as participating in the vote, allowing the player to continue in subsequent rounds if a tie occurs.

Set aside all cards listed in the guide for your player count and shuffle them. These form the Influence Deck.

### 2. Prepare the Network Card Deck

Network cards determine a player's underlying allegiance. These are kept secret from most other players.

1.  Determine the number of Red and Black Network cards needed. You'll need N/2 Red cards and N/2 Black cards, where N is the number of players. If N is odd, round N/2 *up* for both colors (e.g., for 5 players, you'd prepare 3 Red and 3 Black cards, totaling 6).
2.  For Network cards, **only the color matters**. You can use any remaining playing cards or even slips of paper clearly marked "Red" or "Black." Using cards with different backs from the Influence Deck is ideal.
3.  Shuffle these prepared Network cards together. This is the Network Deck.

### 3. Deal Network Cards & Establish Networks

1.  Deal one Network card face down to each player from the shuffled Network Deck.
2.  If there's an odd number of players (meaning you prepared one more Network card than the number of players), one Network card will be left over after dealing. Return this extra card to the game box without looking at it.
3.  Each player secretly looks at their own Network card. Then, they place it face down on the table to their **immediate left**, between themselves and the player to their left.
4.  Once all Network cards are placed, each player then secretly looks at the Network card to their **immediate right** (which is the card their right-hand neighbor placed to *their* left).
5.  The two Network cards each player has now seen (the one they were dealt and placed to their left, and the one their right-hand neighbor placed, now to their right) make up that player's personal **"Network."** This Network remains fixed for the entire game.
    * *Clarification:* Each Network card on the table is part of *two* players' Networks (the player to its right and the player to its left). You are only ever allowed to look at the two cards forming your own Network.

### 4. Deal Influence Cards & Initial Setup

1.  Shuffle the prepared Influence Deck thoroughly.
2.  Deal Influence cards face down to each player according to the "Initial Hand Size" in the **Influence Deck Guide**. This is their starting hand.
3.  If any Influence cards remain after dealing (possible with 5 or 13 players), place them **face down** in the center of the table to start a discard pile. If no cards remain, the first discarded card will start this pile. The discard pile cannot be looked through during the game.
4.  Players may look at their own Influence cards but must keep them secret from others. (You can talk about your cards, even lie, but do so openly at the table.)
5.  **Choose Membership Card:** Each player now secretly selects one card from their hand and places it face down in front of them, ideally between their two (face-down) Network cards. This is their **"Membership Card."** It represents their declared (but still secret) allegiance (for now).
6.  **Free Policy Stacks:** Keep a small, separate stack of readily available Red cards and Black cards nearby (e.g., unused cards from the Network Deck prep or spare slips). These will be used for "Free Policies."
7.  **Initial Stability:** The generation begins with a **Stability of 5**. Keep track of this number.


## Playing the Game

The game proceeds in a series of rounds, starting with an Election.

**Player Status:** If a player runs out of Influence cards in their hand, they can no longer vote in elections or be accused. They are effectively "out" for the rest of the generation but leave their Network and Membership cards in place for scoring.

### Election Phase

1.  **Select Vote:** All players who still have at least one Influence card select one card from their hand and hold it face down at the ready.
2.  **Reveal or Abstain:** Once all players are ready, on a countdown (e.g., "3-2-1-Reveal!"), all players simultaneously either:
    * **Vote:** Reveal their chosen card by flipping it face up.
    * **Abstain:** Return their chosen card to their hand without revealing it. Abstaining players do not participate further in this current election.
3.  **All Abstain?** If *all* players abstain, a **Free Policy** is passed (see "Free Policies" below). Its color is the same as the most recently passed policy. If no policies have been passed yet this generation, nothing is passed. A new election begins.
4.  **Consensus Check:** Look at all cards played face up by voters:
    * If all revealed cards are the **same color** (all Red or all Black), or if **only one player voted**, a "Consensus" occurs!
        * A **Free Policy** of the consensus color is passed.
        * All players who voted take their played cards back into their hands.
        * A new election begins. (The generation might end here – see "Passing Policies & Ending the Generation" below).
5.  **Determine the President:** If there's no consensus (i.e., mixed Red and Black cards were voted):
    * The player who played the highest-ranking card wins the vote and becomes **President**.
    * **Ties:** If there's a tie for the highest card, all currently played vote cards remain face up on the table. All players who participated in this voting round (i.e., did not abstain and still have cards) may now select another card from their hand to vote in a new round. Repeat the voting (Steps 1-2), then re-check Consensus for the new set of votes, then re-check for President among the highest newly played cards. Continue until a Consensus occurs or a single President is chosen.
6.  **Aftermath:**
    * The President discards their winning vote card **face down** into the discard pile.
    * All other players who voted (losing votes, or votes from previous tie-rounds) take their cards back into their hands.
    * The President receives one **Experience Token (XP)**. XP can be kept or freely exchanged between players as part of deals, bribes, or blackmail.

### Presidency Phase

The newly elected President now takes charge. They first have an option to Parley, then may choose one Presidential Action or Pass.

**Optional: Parley**
The President may choose to "Parley" with one other player (the "Target").
1.  The President selects one or more Influence cards from their hand.
2.  The President chooses a Target who has at least that many Influence cards in their hand.
3.  The Target player then selects the *same number* of cards from their own hand.
4.  The President and the Target simultaneously swap their selected sets of cards.

**Presidential Action (Choose one, or Pass):**
After potentially Parleying, the President may choose **one** of the following actions, or they may choose to **Pass**:

* **A) Defect**
    * The President discards their current Membership card **face down** to the discard pile.
    * They then choose a new Membership card from their current hand of Influence cards and place it face down where their old one was.

* **B) Accuse**
    1.  The President chooses a Target player (who must still have at least one Influence card in hand).
    2.  The President publicly accuses the Target of having either a "Red Membership Card" or a "Black Membership Card."
    3.  The Target's Membership card is revealed to all players.
    4.  **Resolve the Accusation:**
        * **If the Accusation was CORRECT:**
            1.  The President takes the revealed Membership card into their hand.
            2.  The Target must secretly choose a new Membership card from their remaining Influence cards and place it face down.
            3.  The President MUST now choose one card from their hand and play it face up on the table. This is an **Enacted Policy**. (The generation might end here – see "Passing Policies & Ending the Generation" below).
            4.  The President's term ends. A new Election phase begins.
        * **If the Accusation was INCORRECT:**
            1.  The Target takes their revealed Membership card back into their hand.
            2.  The Target must then secretly choose a new Membership card from their hand (it could be the same one or a different one) and place it face down.
            3.  The **Target player immediately becomes the new President.** However, this new President *may not* choose the "Accuse" action against any player who has been a President since the last *election* occurred. (They can still Parley, and then Defect, Pass, or Accuse a new player).
            4.  **Crisis Check:** Keep track of consecutive incorrect accusations *since the last election*. If this was the **third** incorrect accusation since the last election, the state is "In Crisis"!
                * The generation's **Stability permanently decreases by 1**.
                * Instead of the (incorrectly) accused player becoming President, their presidency is skipped. Proceed directly to a new Election phase.
* **C) Pass**
    * The President chooses to do nothing. Their term ends.
    * Proceed to a new Election phase.

### Passing Policies & Ending the Generation

Policies are cards played face-up that influence the political climate. They can be passed in two ways:
* **Free Policies:** Passed due to Consensus in an election, or if all players abstain.
* **Enacted Policies:** Passed by a President after a successful Accusation.

Passed policies should be placed face up in the center of the table, in the order of their enactment, such that the most recently passed policy is on top, but all passed policies are visible to all players.

**Generation End Condition:**
The generation ends immediately if, at any point, a number of policies of the **same color** are passed consecutively (without interruption by a policy of the opposing color) equal to the current **Stability** (which starts at 5).
*Example: If Stability is 5, and five Red policies are passed in a row, the generation ends, and Red is the "Winning Color."*


## End of the Generation & Scoring

Once the generation ends and a Winning Color (Red or Black) has been determined:

1.  All players simultaneously reveal their face-down Membership card and their two face-down Network cards.
2.  Each player determines whether they succeeded in aligning with the Winning Color based on their Membership and Network cards as follows:

    * **If your two Network cards are the SAME color** (e.g., both Red or both Black): You are aligned if your network cards are the same color as the Winning color. (Note that in this case, your Membership card color does not matter for this scoring.)

    * **If your two Network cards are DIFFERENT colors** (i.e., one Red and one Black): You are aligned if your Membership card is the same color as the Winning color.

3.  **Tiebreaker:** If multiple players all successfully aligned with the Winning Color, the winners are ordered by the number of Experience Tokens (XP) they have accumulated throughout the generation. The player with the most XP wins any ties.

## End of Generation & Scoring

When the generation concludes and the Winning Color (Red or Black) has been established:

1.  **Reveal All Cards:** All players reveal their Membership and Network cards face up.
2.  **How to Win: Align with the Winning Color**
    A player wins the generation if their allegiance aligns with the Winning Color. This alignment is determined as follows:
    * **If your two Network cards are the SAME color** (e.g., both Red): You win if the color of your Network cards matches the Winning Color. (Note that, in this case, your Membership card's color doesn't matter.)
    * **If your two Network cards are DIFFERENT colors** (e.g., one Red, one Black): You win if your Membership card's color matches the Winning Color.
3.  **Declaring the Winner(s) using Experience Tokens:**
    * If only one player successfully aligns (wins) as described in step 2, they are the sole winner of the generation.
    * If multiple players successfully align (win), the **aligned player with the most Experience Tokens (XP)** is declared the winner.
    * If multiple aligned players also tie for the most XP, they **share the victory**.

## Variant: Multi-Generation Campaign

For a more strategic experience, you can play a Multi-Generation version, consisting of a pre-agreed even number of generations (recommended 2 or 4).

**Campaign Setup:**
* The initial setup for the very first generation is the same as described above.
* **Network Cards Remain:** Players' Network cards, once dealt at the beginning of the first generation, remain unchanged for the *entire game*. Players may secretly look at their *own* two Network cards at any time, but these cards are not publicly revealed until the very end of the campaign for final scoring.

**Setup for Subsequent Generations (after the first):**
1.  Collect all Influence cards (from hands, discards, policy area). Make sure to first remove any "free policies" that were passed during the previous generation, as these do not carry over to the next generation.
2.  Shuffle the full Influence Deck and deal new hands to each player as per the Influence Deck Guide.
3.  If any Influence cards remain, form a new face-down discard pile.
4.  Each player secretly chooses a new Membership card from their new hand.
5.  Stability **increases by 1** for a maximum of 5.
6.  **Historical Echo:** Each new generation (after the first) begins with one **Free Policy** already in play. The color of this initial policy is the same as the Winning Color of the *immediately preceding* generation. This policy is passed before the first election of the new generation and counts towards the Stability policy track.
7.  The new generation begins with an Election.

**Scoring for Multi-Generation Campaign:**
Instead of the ordinary scoring method, the campaign scoring is done in two parts:

1.  **End of EACH Generation:**
    * When a generation ends and the Winning Color is determined, all players reveal their current *Membership cards only*.
    * Each player whose Membership card color matches the Winning Color of that generation immediately scores **1 VP**.
    * The Winning Color of the generation and each player's revealed Membership Card color for that generation should be recorded for final scoring.

2.  **End of the CAMPAIGN (after the final pre-agreed generation is played):**
    * All players now publicly reveal their two Network cards for the first time since the start of the campaign.
    * For **each generation played** during the campaign, each player scores an additional **1 VP for each of their Network cards** that matches the recorded Winning Color of that specific generation.
    * *Example: If Red won Generation 1, a player with a Red Network card scores 1 VP for it for Gen 1. If they have two Red Network cards, they score 2 VP for Gen 1 from their network. This is repeated for all generations.*
    * Sum up all VPs earned at the end of each generation (from Membership cards) and all VPs earned at the end of the campaign (from Network cards) to get each player's total campaign score.
    * **Tiebreaker:** The player with the most Experience Tokens (XP) accumulated throughout the campaign wins any ties in total VP.
